# Dissect :  DisPerSE-based Segmentation for Cells and Tissues
# Segmentation and analysis of highly remodeled epithelial surfaces in 3D


## Overview
`Dissect` library provide a way to segment and analyse apical 3D tissue. Using DiSperSE to generate a skeleton, `Dissect` is able to segment the skeleton and provide morphological analysis. It is also possible to cross the segmentation with other channel for different kind of signal analysis. 


## Documentation
In the repository notebook-DEMO, there is several notebook which explain how to use our tool Dissect.
- **0-ExplainationOfDifferentFile** : Explanation of the process of segmentation with the different file format at different processus of the analysis. 
- **1-Demo-Disperse** : How to install and use Disperse from Thierry Sousbie on 2D and apical 3D images to obtain the best segmentation.
