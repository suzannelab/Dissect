## Overview
`Dissect` library, for DisPerSE-based Segmentation and Exploration of Cells and Tissues, provide a way to segment and analyse apical 3D tissue. Using [DiSperSE](http://www2.iap.fr/users/sousbie/web/html/indexd41d.html) program to generate a skeleton, `Dissect` is able to segment apical surface of tissue on 2D and 3D (Figure 1 A) and provide geometric and signal quantifications. `Dissect` is also able to analyse meshwork signal and provide related analysis (Figure 1 B). Meshwork analysis can be crossed with geometric and/or signal quantification. 
<br>Dissect can be used with a graphical interface or with your own handmade script.

#### Generate a skeleton
Skeleton is generated by [DisPerSE](http://www2.iap.fr/users/sousbie/web/html/indexd41d.html), a C++ program developed by Thierry Sousbie. 
<br>We provide a Docker images with DisPerSE already install that you can use on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). A tutorial of use can be found [here](NOTPROVIDEDYET). 
<br>You can install directly DisPerSE directly from the source code [here](http://thierry-sousbie.github.io/DisPerSE/). 

#### Analyse a skeleton and/or meshwork
Analysis can be done with the graphical interface or with python script. At the end it provides tables with data, and can generate color-coded images.
