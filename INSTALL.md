## Install from source

Those are instructions to install the package from source on a debian-like linux distribution. If you already have a basic scientific python stack, use it. 

### Download and install `Dissects` from source
If you want to do that, I assume you already know how to manage dependencies on your platform. 

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sophietheis/Dissects.git
cd Dissects
python setup.py install
```
